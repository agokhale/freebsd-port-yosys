yosys - Yosys Open SYnthesis Suite
This is a framework for RTL synthesis tools. It currently has extensive Verilog-
2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorit hms for various 
application domains.  Yosys can be adapted to perform any synthesis job by 
combining the existing passes (algorithms) using synthesis scripts and adding
 additional passes as needed by extending the yosys C++ code base.
Yosys is free software licensed under the ISC license (a GPL compatible license 
that is similar in terms to the MIT license or the 2-claus e BSD license).
Together, Yosys, arachne-pnr and IceStorm provide an fully open-source 
Verilog-to-bistream tool chain for iCE40 1K and 8K FPGA development.
